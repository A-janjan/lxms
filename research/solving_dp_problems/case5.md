# 2060. Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings

An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:

Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.
For example, one way to encode an original string "abcdefghijklmnop" might be:

Split it as a sequence: ["ab", "cdefghijklmn", "o", "p"].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes ["ab", "12", "1", "p"].
Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: "ab121p".
Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "internationalization", s2 = "i18n"
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that "internationalization" was the original string.
- "internationalization" 
  -> Split:       ["internationalization"]
  -> Do not replace any element
  -> Concatenate:  "internationalization", which is s1.
- "internationalization"
  -> Split:       ["i", "nternationalizatio", "n"]
  -> Replace:     ["i", "18",                 "n"]
  -> Concatenate:  "i18n", which is s2
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "l123e", s2 = "44"
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that "leetcode" was the original string.
- "leetcode" 
  -> Split:      ["l", "e", "et", "cod", "e"]
  -> Replace:    ["l", "1", "2",  "3",   "e"]
  -> Concatenate: "l123e", which is s1.
- "leetcode" 
  -> Split:      ["leet", "code"]
  -> Replace:    ["4",    "4"]
  -> Concatenate: "44", which is s2.
Example 3:

Input: s1 = "a5b", s2 = "c5b"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible.
- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter 'a'.
- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter 'c'.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 40
s1 and s2 consist of digits 1-9 (inclusive), and lowercase English letters only.
The number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.

### Explanation
- **State Representation:**  
  We use a recursive helper `dfs(i, j, diff)` where:
  - `i` and `j` represent current indices in `s1` and `s2`.
  - `diff` represents the net difference in the count of unmatched letters between `s1` and `s2` (i.e., how many extra letters one side has compared to the other).

- **Handling Digits:**  
  If a digit is encountered in either string, we iterate over possible multi-digit numbers (up to 3 digits) and adjust the `diff` accordingly:
  - For `s1`, subtract the numeric value (since these contribute to extra letters in the original string decoded from `s1`).
  - For `s2`, add the numeric value (as these contribute to extra letters in the original string decoded from `s2`).

- **Handling Letters with Difference:**  
  When `diff` is non-zero, we try to match the extra letters by consuming the appropriate letter from the string that is behind.

- **Direct Letter Matching:**  
  When `diff` is zero, both strings should match letter-for-letter.

- **Memoization:**  
  States are memoized to avoid redundant computations.

The code is a direct Pythonic implementation that solves the problem precisely as required.
